        <h2>Axminster Web Design</h2>
        <p>I work with small businesses in Axminster to create beautiful, user-friendly websites. If a simple
            website is what you're after, you don't need to spend
            thousands on a fancy website from a big agency. Whether you own a thriving small business in Axminster or
            are just
            starting out, I will work with you to create a budget-friendly website that won't break the
            bank. Prices for websites start from as little as £500.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to discuss your Axminster web design, please get in touch for a quote.</p>

            <h2>Low Cost Web Design for Small Businesses</h2>
            <p>I've been working in the web industry for 8 years, working with businesses of all sizes - from small one
                man bands, to start-ups and thriving small businesses. I know how complicated the web industry can seem
                if you don't have experience in it, so I keep it as simple as possible to make sure the process
                is seemless and easy to understand.</p>
            </br>
            <p>Running a small business myself, I know how busy life can get. Business owners have to be all things
                at all times, wearing multiple hats and juggling responsibilities. But rather than spend countless hours trying to learn
                how to build your own website, I can take that item off your to do list.</p>

            <h2>Websites from £500</h2>
            <p>Large web development agencies will convince you that you need to spend £3000 on a simple website but
                it's simply not true. I feel passionately about protecting small businesses from unecessary costs for a
                website that won't grow with your business. Large agencies use bespoke systems to build your "simple"
                website which means that when you want to make a change down the line, you have to pay £££ to make it
                happen.</p>
            </br>
            <p>On the other hand, I will build your website on WordPress, which is a simple, easy-to-use platform that
                is extremely flexible and can easily grow with you and your business. If you decide later down the line
                that you want to add an online shop, it won't cost the earth to add that feature.</p>

                from the initial discussion, through to the launch of the site and supporting you after the launch. Each
                website build is different depending on the needs of each client and business, but most roughly follow
                the below process.

                <p>In this digital age, location is never an issue. We can meet on Zoom or chat over the phone, or if
                    you're local to Axminster, we could meet for a coffee. We will discuss your
                    business, get to know each other and have a chat about your budget and expectations. I can then work
                    out a quote for you and send you a full proposal for you to review.

                    colour scheme, font and style that best reflect your business and industry. I can recommend a

            <p>I'm a female freelance web designer and SEO specialist. 
                I also write and run a travel blog, as I love to travel and explore the world.</p>
