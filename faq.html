        <h2>WordPress and Squarespace Web Design</h2>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">What makes your services different from other web designers and SEO
            specialists?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>I pride myself on being approachable and delivering a service without the jargon. I know that
                website stuff can seem mystifying with all the terms that are thrown about. Many agencies will convince
                you that you need a complex website that costs upwards of £3000 but for most small businesses, it's
                simply not true. I'm on your side and will only recommend website features that I think will genuinely
                help your business. What's more, as a freelancer, I work mostly from home, so I can keep overheads down
                and ensure that the costs of a fancy office and company car aren't passed on to you, ensuring a low cost
                effective website for your business.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">How long does it take to build my website?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>The time it takes to create your website depends on a few factors - how complex the website is, whether
                you have a small website with only a few pages, or a full online shop with 'the works',
                how quickly you can provide content, and whether there are other websites in the pipeline. If you have
                a specific deadline you're aiming for, I'm always happy to have a chat about this and will try to work
                with you to hit deadlines where possible. Generally a simple website can take 4-6 weeks, with a more
                complex website taking from 6-10 weeks to complete. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">What platforms do you use to build websites?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>I build websites on WordPress and Squarespace. Depending on what you need, I can make a
                recommendation for which platform might be best for you, unless you already have a preference.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">How much do you charge?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>My fee for a simple website starts at £600. After an initial chat with you about your business
                and website needs, I will provide a quote for your website. I aim to keep my costs as low as possible to
                make sure small businesses and start-ups can afford a quality website. I don't believe in charging
                thousands for a complicated website that you simply don't need as a small business - even though most
                web
                design agencies will convince you that you do need it!</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Do I need to provide the content?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Noone knows your business as well as you do, so I usually ask you to provide content for your website. I
                am happy to work with you on this. I can let you know what content will be needed and help you rewrite or
                reformat content if that will be helpful.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Is hosting and domain name included?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Hosting and the domain name will need to be purchased separately, and will be charged in addition to the
                website cost. I am happy to help arrange the purchase of these so you don't need to worry about it.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Can I edit the website myself when it's finished?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Absolutely! I make sure all the websites I create are as simple to update as possible. Before we put your
                website live, I will sit down with you in-person, or on Zoom and show you how to update your website. If
                you do need any help after your website is live, you can contact me for support, which I can provide on
                a monthly or a one-off basis.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">What sort of websites do you offer?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>From a simple one-page website to an eCommerce online shop, I am happy to discuss what you need and work
                with you to make sure your website provides all the features that are important to your business. I offer simple websites to help
                small businesses get online. Nothing complicated and over the top - just an efficient online presence
                that gets you in front of your customers.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">How does payment work?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>I ask for 50% payment before the website build starts, and 50% on completion of the project before
                launch, when you're happy with the website.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Can you redesign my existing website, or do you only build new
            ones?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Of course - I love reworking a website that isn't currently working for you and turning it into an
                efficient website that you love. Whether you need a few tweaks to your current website, or a full
                rebrand, I'd love to help!</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Will my website be mobile-friendly and responsive?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Absolutely! There's no way you can get away with a website that isn't mobile optimised in this day and
                age.
                Not only that, but mobile-friendly websites also rank higher in search engines and convert better.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Do you provide ongoing maintenance and support after launch?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>I'm happy to help with any support you need after your website is launched. If you need support on
                an ongoing basis, we can set up a support package, or you can simply get in touch with me as and when
                you need help. I charge £40 per hour for post-launch support.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">What information do I need to provide before requesting a web design
            quote?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>So that I can provide a quote, I need to know what pages are important for your website, what features
                you'd like the website to have such as online reviews, a newsletter sign-up, or something else, whether
                you need a simple website, or an online shop, and how you see the website working for your business.
                It's also useful to know if you have a deadline in mind. We can discuss all of this during an initial call
                or meeting.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Search Engine Optimisation</h2>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">What is SEO and why does my website need it?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving and optimising your website so that search
                engines like Google and Bing can easily find and understand it. The better your SEO, the higher your
                site
                is likely to rank when people search for your products or services. Without SEO, your website might look
                great but struggle to attract the right customers, or any customers at all.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">How long does it take to see results from SEO?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>SEO isn't a quick fix. It’s more like planting seeds than flipping a switch. Most websites start to see
                improvements within 6 months, depending on how competitive your industry is and how much work is
                put into content and optimisation, but I recommend at least 12 months of SEO work to really see results.
                Big results usually come with consistent effort over time. The good news is that once you start climbing
                the rankings, the benefits can really snowball. However, it's worth mentioning that SEO results are
                never
                guaranteed. All we can do is optimise your website for search engines to give you the best chance of
                ranking and getting in front of your ideal client.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Do you include basic SEO setup with web design projects?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>This depends on your budget and the industry you are operating in. SEO isn't always advisable for some
                industries and I'm happy to let you know when I think SEO might not be the right strategy for you.
                I always include a solid SEO foundation when building a site. That means things like optimizing page
                titles, setting up meta descriptions, making sure your site loads fast, and ensuring it works well on
                mobile. This won’t guarantee top rankings overnight, but it sets your website up for success from the
                start. From there, you can build on it with more advanced SEO strategies. If you're on a tight budget,
                we can discuss omitting some of this work to reduce the cost slightly.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Will you help with keyword research and content strategy?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Absolutely! SEO is only as good at your keyword research! I can research what your ideal customers are
                actually searching for and help you plan content around those terms. That might include blog topics,
                service page wording, or even advice on how to structure your site. Good keyword research is the
                backbone
                of SEO, and it’ll make sure your content has the best chance to connect with your audience.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Do you provide ongoing SEO services after the website is live?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Yes, I offer ongoing SEO support because keeping a site visible in search engines is an ongoing job. Search trends,
                competitors, and Google’s algorithms are always changing, so it pays to keep things fresh. I can help
                with regular content updates, technical check-ups, and performance tracking to give your site the best
                chance of
                climbing the ranks, instead of slipping behind.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Can you help improve my current website’s rankings on Google?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Definitely! Even if you already have a site, there’s often plenty of room for improvement. I can run an
                SEO audit to spot what’s holding your site back, like slow loading times, weak content, or missing
                keywords. From there, I’ll create a plan to boost your rankings and bring in more of the right kind of
                visitors.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">How much do you charge for SEO?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>My SEO services start from £150 per month, which covers 5 hours of SEO work per month. If you'd like me
                to spend more time on your SEO in a month, we can discuss alternative packages to really up the ante.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion" id="accordion">Will I be tied into a contract?</button>
        <div class="accordion-panel" id="accordion-panel" style="display:none">
            <p>Investing in SEO can be a fantastic long-term strategy for growing your business, but it does require
                consistency, so I ask for a minimum 6-month commitment from you when starting an SEO contract with me. 
                This is purely because anything less than 6 months would essentially be money down the drain for you and 
                I want to make you get the best value for your money.</p>
